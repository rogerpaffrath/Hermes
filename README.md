# Hermes
 A simple code to detect silent frames on a video.

 ## Configuration
All the parameters for the program are set in the constants defined at the beginning of the main.cpp file:
- VIDEO_PATH: a string pointing to the video file you want to analyze.
- OUTPUT_PATH: a string pointing to the path of the file that will have the timestamps of the silent frames.
- THRESHOLD: this is the tolerance that the analysis function will use. Adjust it to your needs.
